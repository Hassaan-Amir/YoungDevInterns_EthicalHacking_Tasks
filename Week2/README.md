# Week 2 â€“ Scanning, Enumeration, and Vulnerabilities

This week focused on performing advanced scanning and enumeration techniques, exploring password cracking basics, conducting vulnerability analysis, and completing practical hands-on tasks in a simulated environment.

## Scanning & Enumeration

- Performed **advanced Nmap scans** for:
  - Version detection (`-sV`)
  - OS detection (`-O`)
  - Script scanning (`-sC`)
- Used **Nikto**, **Dirb**, and **Gobuster** for:
  - Web directory brute-forcing
  - Vulnerability scanning on web servers

##  System Hacking Basics

- Studied password cracking tools: **John the Ripper** and **Hydra**
- Understood password storage mechanisms:
  - Explored **hash types**
  - Used **wordlists** like `rockyou.txt` for cracking
- Practiced system exploitation with **Metasploitable2** using `msfconsole`

##  Vulnerability Analysis

- Used **Searchsploit** to find public exploits from **Exploit-DB**
- Learned to perform vulnerability scans using **OpenVAS** and **Nessus** (if licensed)
- Researched **CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)** to understand real-world exploits

## Hands-On Tasks

- Cracked password-protected **ZIP** and files using **dictionary attacks**
- Conducted **enumeration** on a vulnerable Linux machine to gather system and user information


>  This week's activities helped build a strong foundation in vulnerability scanning, exploitation, and real-world enumeration techniques.
