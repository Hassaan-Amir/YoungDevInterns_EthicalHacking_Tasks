## 🛠️ Week 1 – Hands-On Tasks: Foundations of Ethical Hacking

This section details the practical exercises undertaken during the first week of the YoungDev Interns Ethical Hacking internship, focusing on applying foundational knowledge in a controlled environment.

### 🔍 Task 1: Nmap Scan on Local Network

As a core component of the initial reconnaissance phase, I performed a basic Nmap scan on my local network. This task was crucial for actively discovering active hosts and identifying open ports.

**✅ Tools Used:**
* `nmap` - The primary tool for network discovery and identifing open ports.
* Terminal (Kali Linux) - For executing Nmap commands and viewing output.

**📌 Objective:**
* To systematically identify IP addresses of active devices connected to the same local network.
* To pinpoint open ports on these devices, indicating potential services running on them
* To gain practical experience with `nmap`.

**🖼️ Screenshots:**
Attached below are screenshots illustrating the Nmap scan command and its output, highlighting identified hosts and their open ports.

### 📡 Task 2: Packet Capture and Analysis using Wireshark

Following network discovery, I used Wireshark to capture and analyze network packets in real-time. This hands-on task was instrumental in understanding network packets.

**✅ Tools Used:**
* Wireshark - A powerful network protocol analyzer.

**📌 Objective:**
* To meticulously observe and understand the detailed structure of network packets.
* To analyze the flow of network traffic, discerning how data moves between devices.
* To identify and analyze common network protocols such as TCP, HTTP, DNS, DHCP, and ARP, gaining insight into their operational mechanics and typical packet formats
* To practice using Wireshark for practical packet analysis.

**🖼️ Screenshots:**
Screenshots illustrating the Wireshark interface, captured packets, and detailed protocol analysis are attached below.

## Key Learnings 

+ How Nmap detects live hosts and ports on a network
+ The types of packets exchanged during scanning (SYN, ICMP, etc.)
+ Practical experience with network scanning and packet capturing tools
