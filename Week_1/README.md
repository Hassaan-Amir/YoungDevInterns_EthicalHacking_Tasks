# YoungDev Interns - Ethical Hacking Tasks - Week 1: Foundations

This repository documents the tasks completed during the first week of the YoungDev Interns Ethical Hacking Internship.

## Week 1: Foundations of Ethical Hacking


### Environment Setup

During this week, a significant focus was placed on setting up the necessary environment for ethical hacking.
* **Kali Linux Installation:** I installed Kali Linux, preparing my virtualized environment for penetration testing activities[cite: 21].
* **Linux Command Line Proficiency:** I began learning basic Linux commands and terminal usage, which are fundamental for navigating and operating within the Kali environment[cite: 22].
* **Secure Lab Environment:** A secure lab environment was established using Kali Linux and Metasploitable2 within VirtualBox, creating a safe space to practice various hacking techniques[cite: 23].

### Networking Basics

Understanding network fundamentals is crucial for ethical hacking, and this week covered:
* **Core Network Protocols:** I gained an understanding of essential networking protocols including IP, MAC, DNS, DHCP, and TCP/IP.
* **Ports, Services, and Packet Structure:** I learned about different ports, network services, and the structure of network packets, utilizing Wireshark for practical analysis.
* **Basic Network Tools:** I practiced using basic network diagnostic tools such as `ifconfig`, `ping`, `netstat`, `traceroute`, and `nmap`.

### Footprinting and Reconnaissance

The initial phase of any hacking project involves gathering information, covered by footprinting and reconnaissance:
* **Passive vs. Active Reconnaissance:** I learned the distinction between passive and active reconnaissance techniques.
* **Reconnaissance Tools:** I explored and used tools like `whois`, `nslookup`, `theHarvester`, and Shodan.io for information gathering.
* **Open Port Discovery:** I practiced discovering open ports on target systems using Nmap.

### Hands-On Tasks

Practical application of the learned concepts was a key part of the week:
* **Local Network Nmap Scan:** I performed a basic Nmap scan on my home network to identify active devices and open ports.
* **Packet Capture and Analysis with Wireshark:** I used Wireshark to capture and analyze network packets, deepening my understanding of networks.
