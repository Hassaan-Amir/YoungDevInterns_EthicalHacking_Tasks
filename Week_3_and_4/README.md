# Week 4 â€“ Exploitation and Privilege Escalation

As part of the **YoungDevInterns Ethical Hacking Program**, Week 4 focused on advanced exploitation and privilege escalation techniques. 

## Exploitation Frameworks
- Used **Metasploit** to exploit known vulnerabilities.
- Deployed payloads on both **Windows** and **Linux** targets.

## Privilege Escalation
- Practiced **Linux privilege escalation** (SUID, cron jobs, environment variables).
- Exploited **Windows privilege escalation** techniques (unquoted service paths, services, tokens).

## Web Application Hacking
- Studied **OWASP Top 10** vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, CSRF, etc.).
- Used **Burp Suite** to intercept and modify web requests.
- Performed **SQL Injection** manually and with **sqlmap**.

## Practical Tasks
- Exploited a vulnerable machine from **VulnHub** (e.g., Mr. Robot).
- Gained **root/admin access** using privilege escalation methods.

## Takeaways
- Gained hands-on experience with real-world exploitation.
- Improved skills in identifying and exploiting system misconfigurations.
- Strengthened understanding of web application vulnerabilities and defenses.
